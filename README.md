# About Me

 As a Python back-end developer and data science enthusiast, my experience includes:

 - Provided support for the implementation of industrial air purifiers, utilizing MicroPython, ESP32, and Arduino technologies during the software development process.

 - Helped in the development of IoT and software solutions for georeferenced data visualization and data processing in the agricultural sector, serving audiences that included clients and other stakeholders.

 - Assisted the team in the development of web applications and software solutions dedicated to georeferenced data visualization and efficient data processing within the agricultural sector, utilizing tools and software like Big Query, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

 - Acquired knowledge related to deploying applications in the cloud using Google Cloud, specifically Google Cloud Run, and Firebase for NoSQL storage.

 - Contributed to the development of automating processes focused on capturing large volumes of data and developing APIs using QGIS for geographic data analysis.

 I have hands-on experience with Back-End frameworks for developing web applications and implementing REST APIs, namely Django, Django Rest Framework and FastAPI. My proficiency extends to database management systems, where I commonly use MySQL as the primary relational database and Firebase as the manager for non-relational SQL databases (NoSQL).

Currently, I have been specializing in computer vision and creating projects that involve backend and machine learning.
